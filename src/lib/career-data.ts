  ],
};

export const idealAnswers: Record<string, string> = {
  "Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript.":
    "var is function-scoped, can be redeclared, and is hoisted with undefined. let and const are block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same scope, and are hoisted in the 'Temporal Dead Zone'. Use const by default for variables that won't be reassigned, and let for reassigned variables. Avoid var in modern ES6+ code to prevent scope leakage and bugs.",
  "How does the React virtual DOM improve performance?":
    "The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, diffs it with the previous one (reconciliation), and computes the minimal set of changes (patching). Batching these updates and avoiding direct, expensive DOM manipulation makes rendering highly efficient.",
  "What is the time complexity of binary search and why?":
    "Binary search runs in O(log n) time. It requires a sorted array. At each step, it compares the target with the middle element. Since the search space is halved in each iteration, the number of steps grows logarithmically with the input size (n, n/2, n/4, ..., 1), which makes it extremely efficient for large datasets.",
  "Tell me about yourself and your career goals.":
    "I am a software engineer focused on building robust, scalable web applications. My career goals are to deepen my expertise in cloud architectures and system design, while contributing to high-impact projects. I strive to bridge technical complexity with business value to build solutions that delight users.",
  "Describe a time you faced conflict in a team.":
    "I use the STAR method. On a past project, a teammate and I disagreed on database schemas. Instead of arguing, I scheduled a collaborative call. We listed the pros/cons of both approaches, benchmarked query speeds, and agreed on a hybrid solution. This improved our system's speed by 20% and strengthened our collaboration.",
  "Why do you want to work here?":
    "I want to work here because your company is at the forefront of AI-driven career development, and I am passionate about building tools that empower professionals. I admire your engineering culture's focus on user impact and speed, and I am excited to apply my full-stack skills to help scale your product.",
  "A production deploy just broke a key feature. Walk me through your response.":
    "First, I would immediately roll back the deployment to the last stable state to restore service for users. Second, I would communicate the issue and status to stakeholders. Third, in a staging environment, I would reproduce the bug, analyze server logs, fix the root cause, verify it with tests, and safely re-deploy.",
  "You disagree with your manager's technical decision. What do you do?":
    "I would schedule a private 1-on-1 to discuss. I'd bring objective data, trade-offs, and prototypes of my proposed approach rather than just raising complaints. I would listen to their business constraints and context. If they still decide on their approach, I would fully commit to making it a success.",
  "How would you onboard onto a large unfamiliar codebase?":
    "I would start by running the project locally and exploring the main user flows. I'd review the documentation and architecture diagrams. Then, I would look at the router and data models to map the structure. Finally, I'd pick up a small, low-risk bug or documentation task to make my first PR and understand the CI/CD pipeline.",
  default:
    "A strong answer is structured (STAR for behavioral), specific with measurable impact, and connects your experience back to the role. Lead with the outcome, then explain your reasoning and the trade-offs you weighed.",
